# Scientific Data Analysis

This project was my first python project in Univeristy. the module is called EE1503 Programming and Design

Scientific Data Analysis 
 
Problem description: Dr Smith is a world-famous scientific expert in Biomedical Engineering. His assistants have performed a large number of complex experiments. The results of these experiments are stored in the file results.txt (this file is available on the EE1503 Moodle page).  
 
This file contains four rows of data – the first row presents the experiment number, starting from 1. 
The second row presents the day of the experiment, in the format of a floating number, dd.mm (e.g: 12.05 represented the 12th day of the 5th month, i.e. 12 May). 
The third row presents the time of the experiment, presented as a floating point number in the format hh.mm (e.g. 15.45 – the experiments occurred at quarter to four in the afternoon).
Finally, the fourth row presents the experimental data, as a floating number.  
 
Dr Smith requests that you make a computer program using Python to perform detailed analysis of the experimental results. The program needs to read the data from the .txt file and also to write new data into another .txt file. The list of functions the program should perform is:  
 
1. The program should be able to read the data from the file results.txt and to display the data on the screen. When doing this, make sure to name the matrix where data will be kept using your first name, for example john_data.  
2. Basic data processing. For the whole data set: 
  a. The program should be able to identify the maximum and the minimum value of the experimental results  
  b. The program should be able to calculate the average value and the standard deviation value of the experimental results  
  c. The program should be able to calculate how many experiments resulted in values greater than some input value 
  d. The program should be able to sort the experiments data (4th row) in ascending and descending order.  
 
Note: the program should have open with a menu for the user, where the user can choose which of the functions 2a-2d they want the program to perform.  
 
3. Data processing for a portion of data. The program should process the data according to functions 2a-2d for the portion of data specified by the user (e.g. for all data between certain times, or for all data on a specific date, or for data for experiment numbers x to y), and to display this in the form “The maximum value for the period … is …”. The program should enable the user to choose the portion of data.
